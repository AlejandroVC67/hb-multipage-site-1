# hb-multipage-site

In this exercise you should separate the user interface from any kind of business logic. For this you can use separate modules that are connected using dependencies (`import` and `export`).

Take into consideration the following global rules for all components:
- Each component should have it's one folder.
- Each component should use the [pug-loader](https://github.com/pugjs/pug-loader) to read the template and generate HTML.
- Each component should be implemented using the mobile first approach.
- Each component should be responsive using the following viewports:
  - Small: 0 - 639px
  - Medium: 640px - 1023px
  - Large: 1024 - âˆž
